
DjVu Imager History

v 1.1:

- c44 console utility is exchanged to fi_c44 console utility (for the sake of the speed).

v 1.2:

- a bug fixed: the program did not work previosly on the single-page DjVu files.

v 1.3:

- a bug fixed: the crush on the last pages of the multypage DjVu files (empty lines in the dump
 file caused an error).

- a bug fixed: the crush on the shared-shapes tags in the dump files.

- a feature added: the support for the BW DjVu-files created in DjVu Solo.

v 1.4:

- a bug fixed: the program did not paste the background on the empty DjVu-pages (that contained
 only the INFO entry).

v 1.5:

- a bug fixed: again the program did not work previosly on the single-page DjVu files (remake of
 v1.2 correction).

v 1.6:

- 2 bugs fixed: 

- after introducing v1.5 the program started to isert 2 or more pics in the wrong order (on the
 pages of a multypage DjVu file).

- the program earlier did not process the multypage DjVu files containing whitespaces and
Cyrillic characters in the internal names of its pages.
This bug was fixed by Leon Bottou because it was determined by the bugs in djvumake and djvudump
(it lead to the update of djvumake and djvudump in DjVuLibre CVS).

v 1.7:

- a bug fixed: the program processed only 2 chunks on the single-page DjVu files (INFO and 
the next one in the chunks list). That usually resulted in the FGbz chunk loss.

v 1.8:

- a bug fixed (in djvumake): the orientaion flag is fixed for the 0 degrees position. Now the 
djvumake'd file is displayed properly in DjVu Reader v2.0.0.26.

v 1.9:

- a bug fixed: if the program was launched by the shortcut to the program's exe then launching 
any console utility from within the program caused the black console window to appear for a 
moment.

v 1.10:

- a bug fixed: when inserting a picture on an empty page the DPI value changed. That resulted 
to the improper displaying of this DjVu-file in WinDjView.

v 2.0:

- This version introduces the new searching principle while finding the glued-on page. Earlier 
the match comparision was based on the NAME of an internal DjVu page file, and now the match is
searched by the NUMBER of an internal DjVu page file. This assures the 100% accuracy of the
match "glued-in - glued-on" DjVu-pages.

Restriction: the glued-on graphical files must have digits in their filenames, and each such
filename must create a unique number representation after the "filename->number" conversion.

The non-digit characters in the filenames are ignored during the "filename-number" conversion.

The best advised filenames are: 

0001.tif, 0002.tif, ... 0010.tif, ... 
or 
0001.tif, 0002.tif, ... 0010.tif, ... 
or 
1.tif, 2.tif, ... 10.tif, ... 
or 
aa1.tif, 2gg.tif, ... fd10gg.tif, ... 

Forbidden is something like this:

aa0001.tif, bb0001.tif, ... cc0001.tif, ...   (would be converted to non-unique numbers)
or 
0002nnn1.tif, 0002kkk1.tif, ... 0021.tif, ... (would be converted to non-unique numbers)

- The "None" custom filename filter is introduced (and made the default one).

- The input folder and the ouput folder now remember the last opened folder (for the next
 opening).

v 2.1:

- This subversion introduces a new feature - the auto-calculated scan numbers.
The filelist has now an extra column - which is filled automatically (at files opening)
with file numbers calculated on the basis of the names of the loaded files.
You can change any such number by double-clicking on it.
Every number signifies the DjVu-page number where this file-illustration is going
to be glued on.

- Another filename filter is added - "Recognize Scan Tailor filenames".
It provides for the proper calculation of the numbers of Scan Tailor filenames.

v 2.2:

- A bug fixed. The loaded files were sorted in the filelist after the file numbers
auto-calculation.

v 2.3:

- a bug fixed: the orientaion flag is fixed for the 0 degrees position - specially for
the case of the background-only DjVu-pages. Now the djvumake'd file is displayed properly
in DjVu Reader v2.0.0.26.

- a bug fixed: the background-only DjVu-pages were created improperly which caused to error
when opening such files in DjVu Reader v2.0.0.26.

v 2.4:

- Added a checkup of the sizes equality between the illustration to be pasted and the
corresponding pasted-on DjVu-page.

v 2.5:

- The the sizes checkup introduced in the previous version is extended to the case of the subsampled
incoming illustrations.

v 2.6:

- The progress dialog for the illustration insertion procedure is introduced.
- The page number checkup is introduced (according to the pasted-on DjVu file page range).
- The checkup at the manual illustration number editing is improved.

- a bug fixed: the "+" button did not have the free filename filter while "Custom filename - None" was on.
- a bug fixed: the "Recognize Scan Tailor filenames" option did not work correctly on some filenames.

v 2.7:

- a bug fixed: the illustration number auto-calculation worked wrong on some filenames.

v 2.8:

- The interface language is now auto-selected at the very first program launch - depending on the language of 
the current user locale (currently only "Russian" is available, otherwise "English" is set).

- a bug fixed: if an error occurred during the encoding the program could not be closed then,
and the progress bar was not filled to the end.

v 2.9:

- a bug fixed: a DjVu with the FG44 chunk was treated improperly.

v 2.9.a:

- a port from MFC to Qt 5.x to support non-Windows systems.

v 2.9.b:

- some changes as fi_c44 was renamed to c44-fi
